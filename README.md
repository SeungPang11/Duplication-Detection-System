# Duplication-Detection-System

Tools
Spark, SQL, Minhash/LSH, Jaccard Similarity

Objective
easy method to detect copying and plagiarism so you can fail those students.

Data 
articles1.csv.zip 
69716, “California lifted its mandatory water restrictions - that could be a huge mistake”. The reference article should be
excluded from the solution.
The Minhash/LSH algorithm relies on the concept of distances to define similarity. For this
exercise, use Jaccard similarity.


Method
Minhash/LSH is an algorithm based on cryptographic hashes that computes similarity between a pair of entities. It is heavily used in Web Search and product similarity. Details of the algorithm can be found in Chapter 3 of Mining Massive Datasets. http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds/ch3.pdf
